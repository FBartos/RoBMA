# Selected-Normal and Posterior Routing

Use this guide when changing posterior evaluation, publication-bias selection
kernels, PIT/CDF/PDF/RNG paths, or effect-direction handling.

## Effect Direction

JAGS returns `mu`, `theta`, and random effects on the original fitted scale,
including when `effect_direction = "negative"`. Do not flip those posterior
samples again. `tau` is nonnegative and is never flipped.

PET/PEESE sampling-bias offsets follow effect direction: add them for positive
effects and subtract them for negative effects. Reuse
`.evaluate.brma.bias_offset()`.

Ordinary normal CDF code owns its direction transformation. Selected-normal
code receives the sign through `.selection_context()`. Callers must not add
another flip.

## Product-Space Routing

For model-averaged publication-bias fits, posterior `bias_indicator` identifies
the active bias branch. Never infer branch identity from `omega` values.

Build one `.selection_context()` for a posterior sample set and pass it to
selected-normal PDF, CDF, RNG, moment, threshold, and plotting helpers. The
context contains branch routing and numerical kernel inputs, including
`bias_indicator`, `use_normal`, and `kernel_mode`.

`.extract_use_normal()` is the supported convenience extractor:

- `TRUE`: the posterior row came from a non-selection branch and uses the
  ordinary normal kernel mode.
- `FALSE`: the row uses its selected-normal kernel.

Do not pass loose `use_normal`, `omega`, or sign arguments through higher
level callers when the context already owns them.

## Unsupported Paths

P-hacking selected-normal branches remain internal and unsupported. Do not
expose or activate them without an explicit maintainer decision and a defined
numerical contract.

## Relevant Files

- `R/evaluate.R`: posterior extraction and bias offsets.
- `R/selection-mapping.R`: selection specifications, contexts, and row routing.
- `R/pdf*.R`, `R/cdf.R`, `R/rng.R`: outcome evaluation.
- `src/selnorm/`: shared native kernels.
- `tests/testthat/helper-selection-kernel.R`: focused test fixtures.

Test positive and negative effect directions, single and product-space models,
and normal versus active selection rows. Use analytic or independent references
for tail calculations.
