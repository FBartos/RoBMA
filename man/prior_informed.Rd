\title{Creates an informed prior distribution based on research}
\usage{
prior_informed(name, parameter = NULL, type = "smd")
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{name of the prior distribution. There are many options based on prior psychological
or medical research.
For psychology, the possible options are
\describe{
\item{\code{"van Erp"}}{for an informed prior distribution for the heterogeneity parameter tau
of meta-analytic effect size estimates based on standardized mean differences
(van Erp et al. 2017),}
\item{\code{"Oosterwijk"}}{for an informed prior distribution for the effect sizes expected in
social psychology based on prior elicitation with dr. Oosterwijk
(Gronau et al. 2017).}
}
For medicine, the possible options are based on Bartoš et al. (2021)
and  Bartoš et al. (2023)
who developed empirical prior distributions for the effect size and heterogeneity parameters of the
continuous outcomes (standardized mean differences), dichotomous outcomes (logOR, logRR, and risk differences),
and time to event outcomes (logHR) based on the Cochrane database of systematic reviews.
Use \code{"Cochrane"} for a prior distribution based on the whole database or call
\code{print(prior_informed_medicine_names)} to inspect the names of
all 46 subfields and set the appropriate \code{parameter} and \code{type}.}

\item{parameter}{parameter name describing what prior distribution is supposed to be produced in cases
where the \code{name} corresponds to multiple prior distributions. Relevant only for the empirical medical
prior distributions.}

\item{type}{prior type describing what prior distribution is supposed to be produced in cases
where the \code{name} and \code{parameter} correspond to multiple prior distributions. Relevant only for
the empirical medical prior distributions with the following options
\describe{
\item{\code{"smd"}}{for standardized mean differences}
\item{\code{"logOR"}}{for log odds ratios}
\item{\code{"logRR"}}{for log risk ratios}
\item{\code{"RD"}}{for risk differences}
\item{\code{"logHR"}}{for hazard ratios}
}}
}
\value{
\code{prior_informed} returns an object of class 'prior'.
}
\description{
\code{prior_informed} creates an informed prior distribution based on past
research. The prior can be visualized by the \code{plot} function.
