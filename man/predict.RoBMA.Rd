\usage{
\method{predict}{RoBMA}(
  object,
  newdata = NULL,
  type = "response",
  conditional = FALSE,
  output_scale = NULL,
  probs = c(0.025, 0.975),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted RoBMA object}

\item{newdata}{a data.frame (if prediction for a meta-regression is performed) or
a list named list with the effect size measure and variability metrics (if prediction
for a meta-analysis is performed) for new studies. Note that the input has to corresponds
to the format and naming that was used to estimate the original fit. Defaults to
\code{NULL} which corresponds to prediction for the observed data.}

\item{type}{type of prediction to be performed. Defaults to \code{"response"} which
produces predictions for the observed effect size estimates. Alternatives are
\code{"terms"} which produces the mean effect size estimate at the given predictors
levels (not accounting for the random-effects) and \code{"effect"} which predicts the
distribution of the true study effects at the given predictors levels
(i.e., incorporating heterogeneity into \code{"terms"}).}

\item{conditional}{show the conditional estimates (assuming that the
alternative is true). Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Only available for
\code{type == "ensemble"}.}

\item{output_scale}{transform the  meta-analytic estimates to a different
scale. Defaults to \code{NULL} which returns the same scale as the model was estimated on.}

\item{probs}{quantiles of the posterior samples to be displayed.
Defaults to \code{c(.025, .975)}}

\item{incorporate_publication_bias}{whether sampling of new values should incorporate
the estimated publication bias. PET/PEESE adjustment is incorporate in all \code{type}
of predictions while selection models adjustment can be incorporated only in
\code{type = "response"}.}

\item{as_samples}{whether posterior samples instead of a summary table should
be returned. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{additional arguments}
}
\value{
\code{pooled_effect} returns a list of tables of class 'BayesTools_table'.
}
\description{
\code{predict.RoBMA} predicts values based on the RoBMA model.
Only available for normal-normal models estimated using the spike-and-slab
algorithm (i.e., \code{algorithm = "ss"}).
}
\details{
Note that in contrast to metafor, the \code{type = "response"} produces
predictions for the new effect size estimates (instead of the true study effects).
To obtain results corresponding to the metafor's predict function, use the
\code{type = "terms"} to obtain the mean effect size estimate in its credible interval
and \code{type = "effect"} to obtain the distribution of the true study effects (i.e.,
prediction interval).

The conditional estimate is calculated conditional on the presence of the effect
(in meta-analysis) or the intercept (in meta-regression).
